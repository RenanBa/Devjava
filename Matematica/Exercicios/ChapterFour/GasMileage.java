// One driver has kept track of several trips by recording the miles driven and gallons used for each tankfull
// Write pseudocode and develop a Application that will input the miles driven
// and gallons of gas used (both as integers) for each trip. The program should
// calculate and display the miles per gallon obtained for each trip and print the
// combined miles per gallon obtained for trips up to this point
// // All averating calculation should produce floating-point results. Use class Scanner and sentinel-controlled


/*
initialize tank capacity to zero
initialize miles driven to zero
initialize gas used to zero
initialize miles average driven to zero
initialize gas average driven to zero
initialize trip counter to zero


prompt the user to enter tank capacity
add this full tank to tank capacity
prompt the user to enter miles driven

While the user has not yet entered the sentinel
  add this gas gallons into gas used
  add this miles into miles driven
  add one to the trip counter
  prompt the user to enter another trip
  input the next grade (possibly the sentinel)

if the counter is not equal to zero
